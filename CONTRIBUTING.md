# Contributing to MEE7

__MEE7__ is a young Discord Bot, so contributions will be reviewed carefully and will not be accepted if they do not meet quality and performace tests so the codebase can stay performant early on.

Before contributing, it would be beneficial for your time, that you check in with one of developers so that your contribution is not wasted, e.g. contributing to a soon to be deprecated part of the codebase.

## New Contributor Guide

To get an overview of the project, read the [README](README.md). 

MEE7 also follows [PEP 8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) and following [PEPs](https://peps.python.org/pep-0000/).

Here are some resources to help you get started with open source contributions using git:

- [Finding ways to contribute to open source on GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/exploring-projects-on-github/finding-ways-to-contribute-to-open-source-on-github)
- [Set up Git](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/set-up-git)
- [GitHub flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow)
- [Collaborating with pull requests](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests)

## Getting started

### Issues

#### Create a new issue

If you spot unexpected code behavior, performance drops, doc issues, [search if an issue already exists](https://github.com/lymieux/MEE7/issues). If a related issue doesn't exist, you can open a new issue using a relevant [issue template](https://github.com/lymieux/MEE7/tree/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE). 

#### Solve an issue

Scan through our [existing issues](https://github.com/lymieux/MEE7/issues) to find one that interests you. You can narrow down the search using `labels` as filters. As a general rule, we donâ€™t assign issues to anyone. If you find an issue to work on, you are welcome to open a PR with a fix.

### Pull Request

The easiest and most visible way to make a contribution is to submit a Pull Request (PR) to the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/lymieux/MEE7).  

When preparing a PR, make sure you label it correctly to track and prioritize the contribution. Use the following labels:
   * The contribution type: enhancement, bug, api
    .... (more to come)

Before creating a pull request, make sure you also
* Update docs on classes and methods
* Add license information on provided source files. An example license header can be found [here](./docs/license-header.txt). 

When you're finished with the changes, create a pull request (PR).
- Fill the "Ready for Review" template so that we can review your PR. Its a simple template to help reviews understand your changes and purpose.
- Don't forget to link the PR to an issue if you are solving one.
- Enable the checkbox to `allow maintainer edits` so the branch can be updated for a merge.

Once you submit your PR, a review team member will review your proposal. We may ask questions or request for additional information.
